  Console application: camera project overview
========================================================================

The application has been created for you by the AppWizard.

This document provides an overview of the contents of each of the files that make up the camera application.


camera.vcxproj
  This is the main project file for a VC++ project generated using the AppWizard, which contains version information for Visual C++ that generated the file, as well as information about the platform, configuration, and project features selected using the AppWizard.

camera.vcxproj.filters
    This is a VC++ project filter file generated using the Application Wizard. It contains information about the association between the project file and the filter. In the IDE, files with similar extensions are displayed in groups under a specific node through this association. For example, a ".cpp" file is associated with the "Source File" filter.

camera.cpp
   This is the main application source file.
